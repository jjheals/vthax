## Inspiration



## What it does

IntelOps is a platform that leverages a combination of optimization with machine learning and generative AI to assist analysts, commanders, officers, and other members of the armed forces and defense industrial base (DIB) in planning, executing, and improving military operations. 


## How we built it

IntelOps consists of three primary components:
- [Frontend built with React](#frontend-react)
- [Backend built with Python and Flask](#backend-flask-python)
- [Cloud infrastructure hosted with Linode](#infrastructure-cloud-linode)

### Frontend (React) 

### Backend (Flask, Python)

### Infrastructure (Cloud, Linode)

## Challenges we ran into

Over the course of VTHacks-12, we had to overcome a few challenges: 

**Computational Limitations**

**Time Constraints**

**Git (naturally)**


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**Time Management & Discipline**

**Improvement since our first ever hackathon (Fall 2022)**

**--- THIRD ACCOMPLISHMENT ---**


## What we learned

**New libraries, modules, & technologies**


**Practice working with complex data structures**

3-4D nested arrays and dictionaries

**Full-stack development**

**Our ability to stay awake for nearly two straight days**



## What's next for IntelOps

- Train and fine tune a more specialized GPT model
- Generate exportable formats for reports
- Interactive visualizations of the inner workings behind the predictions and recommendations
