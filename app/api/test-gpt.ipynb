Infiltration:\\n   - Start the mission on foot from the starting location to avoid detection.\\n   - Use the forested areas as cover to move closer to the target location.\\n   - Utilize the land vehicle to cover more ground quickly, but be prepared to switch to foot if needed to navigate through the mountainous terrain.\\n\\n3. Close target reconnaissance:\\n   - Approach the target location carefully, avoiding detection.\\n   - Use the helicopter for aerial reconnaissance if necessary to gather additional information on enemy positions and the layout of the area.\\n   - Communicate any new intelligence to the team and adjust the plan as needed.\\n\\n4. Extraction:\\n   - Once the HVT is secured, plan the extraction route carefully to avoid enemy detection.\\n   - Use the boat to cross any bodies of water that may be encountered on the way back to the starting location.\\n   - Maintain stealth throughout the extraction process to avoid being detected by enemy forces.\\n\\n5.
